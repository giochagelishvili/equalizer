# Equalizer Landing Page

I am pleased to showcase my latest project, which is the landing page for Equalizer created using HTML & CSS. 

The design was sourced from Figma and presented a challenge in terms of responsiveness, as the layout required significant changes for various screen sizes. Despite these challenges, I invested considerable effort and time to create an interactive, user-friendly and fully responsive webpage. 

I am thrilled with the outcome and look forward to tackling more complex projects in the future.
